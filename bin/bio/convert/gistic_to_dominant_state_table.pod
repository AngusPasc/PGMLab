=head1 DESCRIPTION

This tool is used for converting gistic files dominant state tables.

=head1 NAME

Gistic to observation file converter - PGMLab Bio

=head1 REQUIRED

=item --gistic-file [=] <gistic_filepath>

Input filepath for gistic

=for Euclid:
    gistic_filepath.type = readable

=item --network [=] <network>

The name of the networks that are to be used in the analysis. This is based on the folder name that contains the pairwise interaction file by the same name.

=for Euclid:
    repeatable

=item --db-id-to-name-mapping [=] <db_id_to_name_mapping_file>

Input file contains the mapping between reacome nodes and gene names.

=for Euclid:
    db_id_to_name_mapping_file.type = readable

=item --data-dir [=] <data_dir>

This is the directory that contains the network subdirectories. 

=for Euclid
   data_dir.type=writable

=item --number-of-states [=] <number_of_states>

This is the number of states that we will use when running PGMLab

=for Euclid
   number_of_states.type=integer

=head1 OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS

=item --sample-list-file [=] <sample_list_file> 

This is a list to be used in the header of the dominant state table. If this is not provided the sample names from the header of gistic file will be used. The list should be tab delimited and all on one line.

=for Euclid
   sample_list_file.type=readable

=item --key-outputs-file [=] <key_outputs_file>

This file contains a list of the nodes that you would like kept in the resulting dominant state file. This list should be delimited by newlines. 

=for Euclid
   key_outputs_file.type=readable

=over 8

=item -v[erbose]

Print verbose output as the script runs.
