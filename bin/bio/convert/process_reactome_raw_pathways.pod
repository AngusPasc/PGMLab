=head1 DESCRIPTION

Creates pairwise interaction files from Reactome pathways.

=head1 NAME

Gistic to observation file converter - PGMLab Bio

=head1 REQUIRED

=item --reactome-dir [=] <reactome_dir>

This is the directory containing the tsv files of the pairwise actions files as provided by Reactome. 

=for Euclid:
   reactome_dir.type=readable

=item --processed-dir [=] <processed_dir>

This is the directory containing the pi files of the pairwise actions for each of the pathway. A pathway will be split
into seperate network (pi) files if they are seperate networks in the pathway files. 

=for Euclid:
   processed_dir.type=writeable

=head1 OPTIONAL

=item --flip-logic

If this flag is not set the program will revers ands and with or for all incoming nodes when one of them negatively
interacts with the child.

=item --add-pseudonodes

In order to split the number of parents per child. Use in combination with "max-number-of-parents"

=item --create-pi-file

This will cause the pi files to be generated.

=item --create-analysis-file

This will cause the analyis file to be generated.


=item --max-number-of-parents [=] <max_number_of_parents>

This will be used for adding parents when the number of parents to a node exceeds the max. (default 10)

=for Euclid:
   max_number_of_parents.default=10
   max_number_of_parents.type=int

=over 8

=item -v[erbose]

Print verbose output as the script runs. In particular, a report will be generated containing information on each network.
This includes a check for if the network is a tree and if not whether or not there are cycles. It will list these cycles in standard out.
