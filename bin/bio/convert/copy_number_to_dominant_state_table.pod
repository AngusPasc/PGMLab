=head1 DESCRIPTION

This tool is used for converting copy number files to PGMLab observation files.

=head1 NAME

Copy number to observation file converter - PGMLab Bio

=head1 REQUIRED

=item --number-of-states [=] <number_of_states>

This is the number of states that we will use when running PGMLab

=for Euclid
   number_of_states.type=integer

=item --network [=] <network>

The name of the networks that are to be used in the analysis. This is based on the folder name that contains the pairwise interaction file by the same name.

=for Euclid:
    repeatable

=item --copy-number-dir [=] <copy_number_filepath>

Input filepath for copy number

=for euclid:
    copy_number_filepath.type = readable

=item --ploidy-file [=] <ploidy_filepath>

Input filepath for ploidy file

=for euclid:
    ploidy_filepath.type = readable

=item --data-dir [=] <data_dir>

Analysis directory

=for Euclid:
    data_dir.type = readable

=item --db-id-to-name-mapping [=] <db_id_to_name_mapping_file>

Input file contains the mapping between reacome nodes and gene names

=for Euclid:
    db_id_to_name_mapping_file.type = readable

=head1 OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS

=item --sample-list-file [=] <sample_list_file> 

This is a list to be used in the header of the dominant state table. If this is not provided the sample names from the header of gistic file will be used. The list should be tab delimited and all on one line.

=for Euclid
   sample_list_file.type=readable

=item --key-outputs-file [=] <key_outputs_file>

This file is tab delimited and contains two key columns: reactome_pathway_id pgmlab_node_id. When using this flag you are required provide corresponding reactome pathway ids as well.

=for Euclid:
    key_outputs_file = readable

=item --reactome_pathway_id [=] <reactome_pathway_id>

=for Euclid:
   reapeatable

=over 8

=item -v[erbose]

Print verbose output as the script runs.
